## Abstract
### What is Microsoft IIS?
Internet Information Services (IIS) is a flexible, general-purpose web server from Microsoft that runs on Windows systems to serve requested HTML pages or files. An IIS web server accepts requests from remote client computers and returns the appropriate response. This basic functionality allows web servers to share and deliver information across local area networks (LAN), such as corporate intranets, and wide area networks (WAN), such as the Internet.

### What is Microsft Windows server?
Is a line of Microsoft operating systems (OSes) comprised of extremely powerful machines. Windows Server was first launched in April 2003. Itâ€™s typically installed on heavy-use servers serving as a backbone for most IT companies, applications, and services. The server handles the administrative group-related activities on a network. It organizes, stores, sends, and receives files from devices connected to a network.

### What is WebDAV?
WebDAV, or Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, enhances HTTP to allow users to manage and edit files on a web server collaboratively. It supports file sharing, editing, and versioning directly through a web interface, offering a more collaborative and firewall-friendly alternative to FTP. WebDAV facilitates in-place file editing, making it ideal for team projects.
